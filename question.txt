1. What is PostgreSQL?
Answer: PostgreSQL is an open-source, powerful relational database management system. It supports SQL for querying and advanced features like JSON, full-text search, and indexing. It's known for its stability, extensibility.

2. What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?
Answer: A schema in PostgreSQL is a logical grouping of database objects like tables, views, indexes, functions, etc. It helps in: Organizing the database. Isolating different applications using the same database. Managing permissions by restricting access to specific schemas.

3. Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.
Answer: 
                           Primary Key-
 A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
                           Foreign Key- 
A column that creates a relationship between two tables by referencing a primary key in another table.

4. What is the difference between VARCHAR and CHAR data types?
Answer:                      
                       Storage Efficiency:
VARCHAR: Uses only the required storage space.
CHAR: Always uses exactly n bytes, even if the text is shorter.
                       Trailing Spaces:
VARCHAR: Stores the text as-is.
CHAR: Automatically adds spaces to match the defined length.
                       Performance Consideration:
CHAR is slightly faster for fixed-length fields because of its consistent size.
VARCHAR is more space-efficient when text length varies.

5. Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.
Answer: The WHERE clause filters rows based on a condition.
 example--(SELECT * FROM books WHERE price > 50;)
Retrieves books only where price is greater than 50.
Reduces the number of rows returned.

6. What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?
Answer:              LIMIT- 
Restricts the number of rows returned.
                     OFFSET- 
Skips a certain number of rows before returning results.

7. How can you modify data using UPDATE statements?
Answer: The "UPDATE" statement modifies existing records in a table.

8. What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?
Answer: A JOIN combines data from multiple tables based on a related column.
Types of JOINs: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN

9. Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations.
Answer: "GROUP BY" groups rows with the same values and applies aggregate functions.

10. How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG() in PostgreSQL?
Answer: COUNT(*) → Counts total rows.
SUM(column_name) → Calculates total sum.
AVG(column_name) → Computes average value.
